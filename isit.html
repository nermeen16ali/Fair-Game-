This scenario shows Microaggression, because Lousie displays a behavioural slight towards Jing without it being confrontational or obvious (it is not a direct racist statement or action, but it is a subtle).

                      This is a stereotype which reinforces gender roles. Anyone can wear any colour they want. It is important to break gender roles to allow people to express themselves freely.

                      This is microaggression. It has to do with gender, and the belief that certain genders must behave or act a certain way.

                      This is an example of allyship. We don’t know for sure in this scenario if Joseph has a disability or not, but what we do know is that Oscar is being ableist because he is discriminating against Joseph on the basis of ability.

                      This is an example of allyship because the person filming is doing so for it to act as evidence, and may even themselves be able to act as a witness to the event. When experiencing an wrongful arrest or police brutality, the camera is a powerful tool.
