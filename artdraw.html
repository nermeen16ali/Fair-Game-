                    Gender is a construct, and Gender identity is allowing people to have a personal sense of their own gender. A person’s individual/internal experience with their gender might lead them to sharing their preferred gender pronouns. Using a person’s preferred pronouns validates (confirms) their experience with gender, and shows that you accept them.
