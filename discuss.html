                      Be mindful of the fact that in many cultures, having a respect for parents and elders is emphasized and the approach to sharing a disagreement may look different (some may be more passive, some more upfront, some less confrontational) depending on someone’s cultural upbringing.

                      Mental health stigma can include believing that children cannot experience a decline in mental wellbeing, believing that mental health supports are not needed, or that anything to do with mental health is not real. The big takeaway here is that mental health stigma can prevent someone who needs support for their mental health from seeking further help. We must believe people when they reach out to us about their mental health, no matter their age or even our thoughts about their situation.
